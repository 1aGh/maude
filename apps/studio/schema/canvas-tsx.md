# `canvas-tsx` — the canvas file convention

Contract V2-1.11 §5.2. A canvas is TSX, not data. Its "schema" is this convention plus the lint rules
`maude design check` runs. There is no JSON Schema for it. The design skill teaches it in
`design:design` `_guide-02` (the hard contract).

**Files.** Every `<designRoot>/**/*.tsx` outside `system/`. Runtime folders (`_*`) are never checked.

| Rule | Checked by | Tier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The file parses (oxc, TSX). | `check` → `parse` | fast (every write) |
| Every `<DCArtboard>` has a plain-string `id`, unique in the file. | `artboard-id-missing` · `artboard-id-expression` · `artboard-duplicate` | fast |
| Every lockable, bindable or commentable element keeps its `data-cd-id`. Ids are never renamed, reused or computed (V2-1.4). | `checkIds` vs the pre-edit snapshot → `id-lost` · `id-duplicate` · `id-expression` · `id-format` · `locked-changed` · `cd-attr-changed` | fast |
| Imports come only from `@maude/canvas-lib` and `@maude/ds` (plus the canvas's own siblings). | canvas build in the sandbox | stop |
| Under `dsFidelity: strict`, colours, spacing and type use `var(--…)` tokens. | `ds-check --canvas` S-rules (warnings) | fast (warning) / stop |
| A `kind="web"` artboard has no absolute positioning (flow layout). | `artboards-lint` | stop |
| An artboard's size is its JSX `width`/`height`. Its position lives in `.meta.json` `layout.artboards[]`. | `canvas-rects` / meta schema | — |
| Edit existing canvases with `Edit`, never a whole-file `Write` (over 40 lines). | PreToolUse `whole-file-rewrite` deny | pre-edit |

`errors` block the write, and the PostToolUse hook restores the file. `warnings` go back to the model and never
block. Run it yourself with `maude design check <file> --strict [--against <before>]`.
